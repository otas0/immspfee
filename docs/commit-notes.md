# Commit notes (no history rewrite)

## Duplicate palette payload commits

`4410ed2` and `cc343f0` share the same subject line:

> Cut the lab bundle's palette payload and stop the first screen from fetching every physics model.

Both already landed on `main` / origin. **Do not** squash or rewrite them on
the shared branch (force-push is disallowed). Treat `cc343f0` as the earlier
landing and `4410ed2` as the follow-up that kept the same summary — prefer a
distinct message next time a palette/boot change lands.

## Boot-bundle stash digestion (2026-11-05)

Stashes titled `wip: boot-bundle / pages-check / glyph parallel tree` were dropped
after audit: `_headers`, `scripts/sw-cache.mjs`, and the hashed SW policy were
already on `main`. Remaining stash hunks would have reintroduced on-stage
assumption/caveat strips and undone cold-boot folded domains — rejected against
`AGENTS.md` and `b13c1f5` / `fd779ba`.

## Parallel agent file locks

`uchg` (user immutable) on `index.html` / related files caused
`Operation not permitted` on unlink/write while two Cursor hosts ran
(`extension-host Agents Window`, `extension-host immspfee-education`).
Clear with `chflags nouchg <path>` (or `chflags -R nouchg .` in the repo).
Do not set `uchg` from agents; close the extra Agents Window when racing the lab tree.
